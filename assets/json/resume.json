Developed a novel zero-shot approach for Scene Graph Relationship Prediction using VLMs, reframing Predicate Classification as an MCQA task and surpassing trained baselines by at least 7% for balanced relationship prediction. Designed an open-ended relationship generation framework to eliminate answer-choice biases and improve contextual understanding. 2. Conducted comparative analysis of Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation approaches, highlighting the superiority of saliency maps over CAMs and introducing stochastic aggregation to enhance saliency effectiveness."
