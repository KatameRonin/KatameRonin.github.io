I’m Amartya Dutta, a computer science Master’s student at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), where my current work revolves around large language models and multimodal AI. I’m particularly excited about the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and language understanding. I'm currently a part of the [Knowledge Guided Machine Learning (KGML) Lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/) at Virginia Tech where I'm advised by [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/).

In addition to my work in multimodality, I’ve tackled projects like scene graph generation and weakly supervised semantic segmentation, both of which have deepened my understanding of computer vision and AI. My journey started at [IIIT Guwahati](https://www.iiitg.ac.in/), where I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and worked on machine learning problems, mentored by [Dr. Ferdous Ahmed Barbhuiya](https://www.iiitg.ac.in/computer-science-and-engineering/dr-ferdous-ahmed-barbhuiya-2).

My technical experiences extend beyond research—during internships, I developed interactive AR and VR applications, honing my problem-solving creativity. I’ve worked on augmented reality and virtual reality, which gave me the chance to explore user experience design and secure interactions with virtual environments.

When I’m not working on research problems, I’m likely immersed in online gaming, soccer, or music. I’m also very passionate about singing and playing percussion, and I’ve been part of two bands [Kala@VT](https://www.instagram.com/kala_vt/?hl=en) and [Ataasi The Band](https://www.instagram.com/ataasi_the_band/) throughout my academic life.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat about some interesting AI research topics, or just jam on some music!
