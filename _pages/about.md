I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), focusing on cutting-edge research in large language models and multimodal AI. My passion lies at the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and language understanding. I am currently a member of the Virginia Tech [Knowledge Guided Machine Learning (KGML) Lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/) where I am advised by [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/).

In addition to my work in multimodality, I have contributed to projects such as scene graph generation and weakly supervised semantic segmentation, which have deepened my expertise in computer vision and AI. My academic journey began at [IIIT Guwahati](https://www.iiitg.ac.in/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, working on machine learning problems under the guidance of [Dr. Ferdous Ahmed Barbhuiya](https://www.iiitg.ac.in/computer-science-and-engineering/dr-ferdous-ahmed-barbhuiya-2).

Outside of academics, I enjoy online gaming, soccer, and music. I am deeply passionate about singing and percussion, having been part of two bands, [Kala@VT](https://www.instagram.com/kala_vt/?hl=en) and [Ataasi The Band](https://www.instagram.com/ataasi_the_band/) throughout my academic life.
