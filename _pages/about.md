I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu/), where I am co-advised by [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/) and [Dr. T.M Murali](https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~murali/). My research focuses on Language Models and multimodal AI. During my Masterâ€™s, I was advised by [Dr. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/) and explored Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for predicting structured Scene Graph relationships without additional fine-tuning. I am currently involved in the [Community Empowering Pandemic Prediction and Prevention from Atoms to Societies (COMPASS)](https://www.compass-pipp.org/) project at Virginia Tech.

My academic journey began at the [Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati (IIIT Guwahati)](https://www.iiitg.ac.in/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering under the guidance of [Dr. Ferdous Ahmed Barbhuiya](https://www.iiitg.ac.in/computer-science-and-engineering/dr-ferdous-ahmed-barbhuiya-2). 

Outside of academia, I enjoy online gaming, soccer, and music. I am deeply passionate about singing and percussion, and I have been involved with bands such as [Kala@VT](https://www.instagram.com/kala_vt/?hl=en) and [Ataasi The Band](https://www.instagram.com/ataasi_the_band/) throughout my academic career.
